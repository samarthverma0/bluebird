I was not enthusiastic about football but I went to save myself from getting bored at home. Those days I used to live in a colony where most of the people were Muslims; there were approximately 30-40 children of my age group in my colony. There was a boy called  Junaid who used to bring his bat and ball. His family members were narrow minded and so was he. Junaid   never allowed me to play with him . He  stopped me from using  his bat and ball and that’s why I could not play with my colony friends .One day, during Ramzan, after running for half an hour our coach asked us to rest for ten minutes. That time I came to know that I had forgotten to bring my water bottle. So instead of just asking my colleagues to give me some water to drink, I went to them and I said, “Hey, my name is Altaf and I am fasting due to Ramzan but now I can not control my thirst. So, can I get some water to drink? I thought they would be kinder towards me and I’ll get special treatment. What I thought was accurate since all of them offered me to share their water. But one boy was continuously staring at me; that boy‘s name was Ramanadhan Sastry.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":3,"column":1187,"offset":1188}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":3,"column":1187,"offset":1188}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One day our coach organised a match between one team lead by Arjun and the other team by Ramanadhan. My good friend Parth was on Ramnaadha’s team , so I asked Ramandhan to take me in his team too but he refused saying that they were having sufficient players. After that Parth went to him asking why he lied even though they needed me in their team. Ramanadhan’s reply was something that made me speechless and drove me into a state of melancholy.  He told Parth that he is a Muslim and so how can he sit with me , play with me and be my teammate? He said that if he allows me to play with them I would be the main reason for their disunity. Junaid’s and Ramanadhan’s ideas were so similar but they both belonged to different communities.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":1190},"end":{"line":5,"column":739,"offset":1928}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":1190},"end":{"line":5,"column":739,"offset":1928}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":" One day while I was sitting in my balcony staring at Junaid and his friends playing cricket, Junaid hit the ball with all his strength and the ball unfortunately strukes the bonnet of ex : major Basheer Mohamad’s car and entered his house and injures his goat which he had brought for the night’s feast . What happened next was a devastating experience for Junaid as the infuriated goat started running behind him. I ran downstairs got on my cycle and rode behind the goat and charged it with my whole strength . Fortunately or unfortunately, i don’t know , I lost control and fell on the harmless goat; it could not handle my weight and it collapsed. And in the confusion I protected Junaid from this frail beast’s horns.\nAfter that something happened that I never expected, Junaid hugged me tightly and said, “thank you, bhaijaan”. His words inspired an emotion of joy within me.

One day while we were going back home, I saw them walking in front of me. I was wondering what would happen if the bottle in his sister’s hand, which she was juggling, fell on her own feet when suddenly two men on a bike wearing helmets came to a halt near Ramanadhan. They were enquiring about an address and all of a sudden the man on the backseat (the pillion rider) clutched his sister from his biceps and started to ride away; I picked up a stone from the ground and threw it with sheer will; that stone hit the rider on his hand and they lost the balance. The bike swerved and fell to the ground with a shrilling sound. A group of people came running from one side of the road while I ran from the other. I asked his sister, “are you okay?” to which she replied, “I’m fine now, thank you”. Ramnadhan hugged me tightly saying, “thank you, bhai”. His emotions moved me and brought tears to my eyes and a smile to my face.
